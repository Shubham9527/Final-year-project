# Artificial Agriculture-Web-Application üßë‚Äçüåæ

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

The plant diseases are such as fungi, bacteria, and viruses. The leaf diseases not only restrict the growth
of the plant but also destroy its crop.

There is the need of some expert to identify plant diseases but manual identification is time consuming.

Furthermore, if someone need a farm animal, he must travel to each hamlet to locate the animal, which
takes time and money; therefore, this initiative wants to save time and money by making the animal
available to him.

Farmers don‚Äôt get the price they want since they don‚Äôt know whether the cost of their products will rise
or fall.

Farmers are having a lot of difficulty farming as a result of climate change. It would be simpler for them
to cultivate if they are aware of weather for the upcoming few days in advance.
